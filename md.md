Awesome—let’s turn your “Comprehensive Banking Database” into a production-ready, executive dashboard plan. I peeked at your dataset (5,000 rows × \~40 columns). Key fields we can leverage include:

* Customers: `Customer ID`, `Age`, `Gender`, `City`
* Accounts: `Account Type`, `Account Balance`, `Date Of Account Opening`, `Last Transaction Date`, `Branch ID`
* Transactions: `TransactionID`, `Transaction Date`, `Transaction Type`, `Transaction Amount`
* Loans: `Loan ID`, `Loan Amount`, `Loan Type`, `Loan Term`, `Interest Rate`, `Loan Status`
* Cards: `CardID`, `Card Type`, `Credit Limit`, `Credit Card Balance`, `Minimum Payment Due`, `Payment Due Date`, `Last Credit Card Payment Date`
* Feedback/Ops: `Feedback ID`, `Feedback Type` (Complaint / Suggestion / Praise), `Feedback Date`, `Resolution Status`, `Resolution Date`
* Risk flag: `Anomaly` (binary)

Below is a complete blueprint you can hand to your Power BI developer (or follow yourself).

# 1) Dashboard Objectives (Executive-aligned)

**Primary goals**

1. **Performance & growth**: Track deposits, loans, card utilization, and product mix by branch/city/customer segment.
2. **Customer health**: Monitor activity, recency, retention risk (inactivity), and feedback quality (NPS proxy).
3. **Operational excellence**: Watch SLA/time-to-resolution, complaint rates, and branch productivity.
4. **Risk & compliance**: Flag anomalies, loan status trends, and early warning signals.
5. **Actionability**: Provide drill-downs from bank → branch → customer → transaction with guided narratives and “Next best action”.

---

# 2) Data Model (Star schema from your single CSV)

Although your data arrives as one wide table, model it in Power BI as a star:

**Dimensions**

* **DimCustomer** (`Customer ID`, `Age`, `Gender`, `City`)
* **DimAccount** (`Customer ID`, `Account Type`, `Date Of Account Opening`, `Branch ID`)
* **DimLoan** (`Loan ID`, `Loan Type`, `Loan Term`)
* **DimCard** (`CardID`, `Card Type`)
* **DimBranch** (`Branch ID`)  *(If you later get branch names/regions, add columns here.)*
* **DimDate** (calendar for all date fields)

**Facts**

* **FactTransactions** (`TransactionID`, `Customer ID`, `Transaction Date`, `Transaction Type`, `Transaction Amount`)
* **FactAccountsSnapshot** (periodic snapshot of `Account Balance`)
* **FactLoans** (`Loan ID`, `Customer ID`, `Loan Amount`, `Interest Rate`, `Loan Status`)
* **FactCards** (`CardID`, `Customer ID`, `Credit Limit`, `Credit Card Balance`, `Minimum Payment Due`, `Payment Due Date`)
* **FactFeedback** (`Feedback ID`, `Customer ID`, `Feedback Type`, `Feedback Date`, `Resolution Status`, `Resolution Date`)
* **FactRisk** (`Customer ID`, `Anomaly`, plus any derived risk scores)

**Key relationships**

* `DimCustomer[Customer ID]` 1—\* → all fact tables with `Customer ID`
* `DimBranch[Branch ID]` 1—\* → `DimAccount[Branch ID]` → use for branch rollups
* `DimDate[Date]` → *active* to `FactTransactions[Transaction Date]`; *inactive* roles for `Date Of Account Opening`, `Feedback Date`, `Resolution Date`, `Payment Due Date` (activate via `USERELATIONSHIP` in DAX)

# 6) Core DAX Measures (ready to paste)

> Replace table names with your final names (e.g., `'Transactions'`, `'Accounts'`, `'Loans'`, `'Cards'`, `'Feedback'`, `'Customers'`, `'Date'`).

**Entity counts & activity**

```DAX
Total Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Customers[Customer ID])

Active Customers (90d) =
VAR Cutoff = MAX('Date'[Date]) - 90
RETURN CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(Customers[Customer ID]),
    Customers[Last Transaction Date] >= Cutoff
)

New Accounts =
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(Accounts),
    USERELATIONSHIP('Date'[Date], Accounts[Date Of Account Opening])
)
```

**Deposits & loans**

```DAX
Total Deposits = SUM(Accounts[Account Balance])

Total Loans = SUM(Loans[Loan Amount])

Loan-to-Deposit Ratio = DIVIDE([Total Loans], [Total Deposits])

Weighted Avg Interest Rate =
DIVIDE(
    SUMX(Loans, Loans[Loan Amount] * Loans[Interest Rate]),
    [Total Loans]
)
```

**Transactions**

```DAX
Txn Count = COUNTROWS(Transactions)
Txn Amount = SUM(Transactions[Transaction Amount])

Txn Amount (M) =
CALCULATE([Txn Amount], DATESMTD('Date'[Date]))
```

**Cards**

```DAX
Total Credit Limit = SUM(Cards[Credit Limit])
Total Card Balance = SUM(Cards[Credit Card Balance])
Card Utilization % = DIVIDE([Total Card Balance], [Total Credit Limit])
```

**Loans process**

```DAX
Loan Approvals = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Loans), Loans[Loan Status] = "Approved")
Loan Applications = COUNTROWS(Loans)
Approval Rate % = DIVIDE([Loan Approvals], [Loan Applications])
```

**CX & Ops**

```DAX
Complaints = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Feedback), Feedback[Feedback Type] = "Complaint")
Praise = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Feedback), Feedback[Feedback Type] = "Praise")
Suggestions = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Feedback), Feedback[Feedback Type] = "Suggestion")
Total Feedback = COUNTROWS(Feedback)

Complaint Rate % = DIVIDE([Complaints], [Total Feedback])

-- NPS Proxy: treat Praise=Promoters, Complaint=Detractors, Suggestion=Passives
NPS Proxy % = DIVIDE([Praise], [Total Feedback]) - DIVIDE([Complaints], [Total Feedback])

Avg Time to Resolution (days) =
AVERAGEX(
    FILTER(Feedback, NOT ISBLANK(Feedback[Resolution Date])),
    DATEDIFF(Feedback[Feedback Date], Feedback[Resolution Date], DAY)
)
```

**Retention & risk**

```DAX
Inactive Customers (180d) =
VAR Cutoff = MAX('Date'[Date]) - 180
RETURN CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(Customers[Customer ID]),
    OR(ISBLANK(Customers[Last Transaction Date]), Customers[Last Transaction Date] < Cutoff)
)

Churn Risk % = DIVIDE([Inactive Customers (180d)], [Total Customers])

Anomaly Rate % =
DIVIDE( CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Customers), Customers[Anomaly] = 1), [Total Customers] )
```

**RFM building blocks**

```DAX
Recency (days) =
VAR lastTxn =
    CALCULATE(MAX('Transactions'[Transaction Date]), ALLEXCEPT(Customers, Customers[Customer ID]))
RETURN DATEDIFF(lastTxn, MAX('Date'[Date]), DAY)

Frequency (90d) =
VAR Cutoff = MAX('Date'[Date]) - 90
RETURN CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Transactions'), 'Transactions'[Transaction Date] >= Cutoff)

Monetary (90d) =
VAR Cutoff = MAX('Date'[Date]) - 90
RETURN CALCULATE(SUM('Transactions'[Transaction Amount]), 'Transactions'[Transaction Date] >= Cutoff)
```

# 8) Advanced Analytics (AI/ML opportunities)

1. **Churn prediction (binary)**

   * **Features**: Recency, Frequency, Monetary, Complaints in last N days, Card utilization, Loan status, Balance trend
   * **Label (proxy)**: Inactive ≥180d (until true churn/closure is defined)
   * **Action**: Export “Save List” of high-risk customers with recommended offers

2. **Next Best Product (cross-sell)**

   * **Approaches**: Association rules on product combinations; gradient boosting on RFM + demographics
   * **Output**: Propensity scores; tie to Page 13

3. **Fraud/anomaly scoring**

   * Start from `Anomaly` as weak label; enrich with transaction velocity and amount z-scores; unsupervised LOF/Isolation Forest

4. **Loan risk early warning**

   * Predict probability of loan **closure**/rejection or customer attrition based on usage, rate, and term features

5. **NPS / CX insights**

   * If you add **free-text** comments, run topic modeling + sentiment to surface themes; current proxy uses type only

> Integrate ML outputs back into DimCustomer (scores + buckets) for slicing.

---

# 9) Storytelling & Actionability

* **Context first**: Each page opens with 3–7 KPIs and a one-line headline (“Deposits up 3.2% MoM; Loan approvals down 1.1% — Tucson branch driving decline”).
* **Comparative defaults**: Show *MoM, YoY* deltas and rank branches; color code beyond thresholds.
* **Guided questions** (bookmark buttons):

  * “Where did approvals drop?” → filters on Loan Type = X; Branch rank view
  * “Who is at risk of churn?” → RFM quadrant with “High recency, low frequency” highlighted
  * “Which branches miss SLAs?” → Ops page filtered to `Resolution Status <> Resolved`
* **Call-to-action tiles**: “Download customer save list”, “Email Branch Manager”, “Open Case”

---

# 10) Data Preparation & Governance (step-by-step)

**Modeling steps in Power BI**

1. **Import & type casting**: Parse *all* date fields; set numeric data types; mark DimDate as date table.
2. **Create tables**: Split the wide CSV into facts/dims using Power Query (Reference queries + Select Columns).
3. **Keys & relationships**: Ensure `Customer ID`, `Loan ID`, `CardID`, `Branch ID` keys; relate to DimDate as needed.
4. **Slowly changing dims (if needed)**: If account types change, keep snapshot in FactAccountsSnapshot.
5. **Role-playing dates**: Create multiple active/inactive date relationships; use `USERELATIONSHIP` in measures.
6. **RLS**: Branch-level RLS on `DimBranch[Branch ID]`.
7. **Performance**:

   * Aggregations on month grain for transactions
   * Incremental refresh on FactTransactions by `Transaction Date`
   * Disable auto date/time; prebuild DimDate
8. **Documentation**: Glossary page; measure descriptions; tooltip pages for definitions.

# 11) Data Source Plan (today vs future)

**Available now (from your CSV)**

* Deposits, loans, transactions, cards, feedback, ops, anomaly flags

**Add next**

* **GL/ALM** (interest income/expense → NIM)
* **Digital events** (mobile/web logins → Digital Adoption)
* **Ticketing/CRM** (case texts for CX NLP)
* **Branch directory** (name, region, manager)

## Quick Next Steps (you can do today)

1. Build the star model in Power BI using Power Query references (split into facts/dims).
2. Create the DAX measures above and wire **tooltips** for definitions.
3. Lay out Pages 1–5 first (Exec, Customer 360, Transactions, Loans, Branch).
4. Add RFM measures and the **Customer Profile** drill-through.
5. Reserve placeholders for NIM/digital metrics; show a “Connect data” tile so execs understand scope.

If you’d like, I can generate a **starter PBIX spec** (tables, relationships, all measures pre-typed) or a **Power Query script** to split your CSV into the star schema you need—just say the word and I’ll produce it here.

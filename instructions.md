Done. I’ve generated a starter kit you can import straight into Power BI:

Download the Power Query script — builds the star schema from your existing Raw query (splits into Dim/Fact tables + DimDate).

Download the DAX measures library — paste into a Measures table to light up the KPIs.

Download the setup guide — step-by-step modeling and relationship instructions.

How to use (quick)

Load your CSV in Power BI and name the query Raw.

Add a Blank Query → Advanced Editor → paste power_query_star_schema.m.

The query returns a record of tables. Right-click each item → Convert to Table → Enable Load and rename as suggested.

Mark DimDate as the date table; create the relationships listed in the README.

Create a Measures table and paste the contents of dax_measures.txt.

Start building the first 5 pages (Executive, Customer 360, Transactions, Loans, Branch).

If you want, I can also generate:

A ready-made bookmark set (Executive Monthly / Risk Watch / Growth Focus).

A basic PBIX theme JSON for consistent colors/labels.

Tooltip pages (definitions + small charts) to drop into your visuals.
